Implement Dijsktra's algorithm for finding optimal paths using:
 1. Data structures
 2. C or C++

**Important**
<<<<<<< HEAD
 *The input should will be*:
- N M - number of nodes and number connections 
- n1 n2 w - M lines of node1 and node2 numbers and the weight of the connection
- a b - on the M+1-st line, vertices a and b whose shortest path you should find, -1 if there is no path

On the exit - one number - the length of the path. With a newline at the end or not, it's ok both ways.
=======
 *The input is going to be be*:
- `N M` - number of nodes and number connections 
- `n1 n2 w` - M lines of node1 and node2 numbers and the weight of the connection

**The grading will include mostly code reviewing - write good code.**
