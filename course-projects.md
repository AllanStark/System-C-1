# List of ideas for projects for the course

1. Make a driver for the mouse that is using your smartphone's accelerometer(or something else from your smarthone? )

2. Make a wifi signal jammer(a program that lists the wifi networks and lets you choose which ones to jam, too easy, maybe add some more functionality)

3. Make a mobile wifi signal jammer to run on your rooted smarphone

4. Make a recorder of the screen(for screen casts) make it record audio too. How light can it be?

5. Make an IPC library with modules for local IPC, over the network IPC, over bluetooth IPC, maybe it should allow asynchronous communication with callback answers... . The IPC should have a server and every process connects to it and tells him his name and if anyone has messages for him it sends them using the name. OR IMPLEMENT MQTT. 

6. Implement MQTT https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9IEnpi4-Yc

7. Make a gossiping IPC. IPC that is similar to how gossips spread. Use your imagination. 

8. Make face recognition for sudo authentication.

9. Make a webcam streamer - server and client. The server allows clients to connect and watch what is going on the webcam. (Later, integrate it with paypal :D )

10. Pipe your microphone to another computer over the network. It should easily connect over routers and stuff, so you can talk to your collegue form home while he is at work. Make pranks.

11. Make fiber thread lib.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber_%28computer_science%29
